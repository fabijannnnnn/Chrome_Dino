# Chrome Dino
A simplified version of the Dinosaur Game, also known as 
Chrome Dino, developed by Google.

## Usage
The goal of this game is to avoid cacti on the screen by jumping. 
Press the SPACEBAR to jump or to start a new game.

## Installation
- mkdir dino
- cd dino
- git clone https://github.com/fabijannnnnn/Chrome_Dino.git

## Features
This game features a what appears to be running dinosaur along 
with three types of cacti, score and high-score. 
I plan on adding more features such as moving ground, clouds, 
background and flying dinosaurs in the future.
